# RGB-clustering-using-K-means

We are using k-means algorithm to cluster the red ,green and blue pixels of a image. The value of the pixel is determined by (255,0,0) red,
(0,255,0)green and (0,0,255) blue. The color of a particular pixel can be varied by varying the intensity of color in each pixel.
We can take any three random points and make them as centroid. We can then iterate over all the pixels and we can cluster them into three groups  based on the eucledean distance from the centroid.
